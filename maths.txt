Cartesian pattern:

1) [ x= y= i ] => forms diagonal

2) x * (x*Math.pow(x,4)) => forms slope

3)Right angle Triangle mantra SOH, CAH, TOA.
	SOH=> sin = opposite/hypotenuse
	cAH=> cos = adjacent/hypotenuse
	TOA=> tangent = opposite/adjacent
	
	Not a right angle triangle, then use pythagorus therom to find length of longer side of triangle(the one with $ sign below)
	 a
	----
    |  /
  b | $ c 
	|/
		phythogrous therom:
			c-square = a-sq + b-sq;
			
		//moving the square on c to RHS,
		c = sqrt( (a*a)+(b*b) )
	
4) Draw circle:
		x = cx + cos(rad)*Radius
		y = cy + sin(rad)*Radius
		cx,cy =>center of circle
		rad => radient of circle, incremented from 0 to 2*Math.PI, for instance u want 0 -> 2.PI in 15 steps, then, 360/15.

		Note: Math.sin() & Math.cos() takes radian as param not deg. So we need to convert deg to radian before passing it.

Angle To Radian:
			radianVal = (Math.PI/180) * angle_in_degree; |or| 2*PI*(deg/360);

Radian to Angle:
			DegreeVal = radianVal * (180 / Math.PI);
	
5) Draw half sine wave:
	x = some constant incremented value;
	y = starting_y_val * Math.sin(counter); //counter => range from 0 to incremented with step, for 100 iteration i.e., step = Math.PI/100
	
6) Draw Pologan (any number of face based on n value)

	context.moveTo(x+Math.sin(radiant_angle)*Radius, y-Math.cos(radiant_angle)*Radius);
	delta = 2*Math.PI/n
	for(var i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		radiant_angle += delta
		context.lineTo(x+Math.sin(radiant_angle)*Radius, y-Math.cos(radiant_angle)*Radius);
	}

7) Farenheit and Celsius Formula:

	Celsius = (F-32)*5/9
	
8) Mean and Variance:
	Ex: 2,3,4,7
	Mean is the average of given values, Hence for given values, Mean=(2+3+4+7)/4 = 4.
	
	Variance is average of squared difference of values, means subtract the mean and then square the resul, take the average finally.
	2-4 = -2*-2 = 4
	3-4 = -1*-1 = 1
	4-4 = 0
	7-4 = 3*3 = 9
	
	variance = (4+1+0+9)/4 = 3.5
